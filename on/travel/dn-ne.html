        <h1 style="margin-bottom:0px;">USA: Weekdays in Manhattan</h1>
        <h4  style="margin:.5em; margin-left: 0px;"><i>New York City: Brooklyn, Staten Island, Manhattan</i></h4>

        <h5>Sleepless conferences; endless entertainment.</h5>

		<p>Did you ever have to live in a college dorm room? Did you wish the arcades never closed? Were you young enough that your generation still had them, and they were popular, post-high school? What is your generation? Did culture and trends declare you “aged out”? Did you sleep last night? Did you hear the train go by? That guy next door puking his brains out because he’s completely wasted? That girl last night; it wasn’t me.<br><br>

        How was that tech conference? The one hosted by the company publicly protest out of the city of New York. It’s like my youthful university days never really ended. I can get up, jump on a bus, travel halfway around the country, on a whim’s notice and visit a city that never sleeps. A party that never stops. A crowd for the masses. Surrounded by people who move with one purpose. A purpose I share.<br><br>

        Enjoy the moment. Time’s fleeting. You’ve heard it all before, but if you responded the same way, you didn’t grow. If you want it, you should grab it, while you still can. Wander. Explore. Exploit.<br><br>

        Not many people get to make their own agenda. Get to choose where there go, what they do, and who they choose. Yet for a country called the land of the free, Since 1776 we’ve only been at peace for 20 years. That’s war time 222 out of the 239 years since birth. We have a statue gifted to us by France of Liberty. But no monument for the pursuit of happiness. Just 648.8 billion dollars allocated for discretionary defense.<br><br>
