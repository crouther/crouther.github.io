        <h5>Foreign walks adrift a sea of blank faces:</h5>

		<p>Tokyo, Japan. What started as two weeks of instant gratification quickly devolved into a month of wholesome living and humble beginnings. I planted roots in Fuji Kawaguchi-cho. Worked a house that became my home, to which I shared with only the best strangers from around the world. Marketing the foothills of Yamanashi and locale. When my time came, I was whisked away but an international dance group into Yokohama and back into Tokyo.<br><br>

        A quick flight South to Fukuoka reminded me the world could lack homogeny, yet human desire remained. I walked to Temple in Saga to remind myself that wisdom of temporary absence. Ha, I know funny right?<br><br>

        Swam by raft off a deserted island and back again to the main land. Camped on shorelines and local fishing spots. Scouted business complexes for future ventures. After trying it all, finally, I made haste to my next country, Korea.<br><br>

        On the flight over, I recounted these cities, quotes and realizations shared by my fellow vagabonds:<br><br>

        “You can be completely surrounded by people yet feel completely alone. Honesty is easily perceived and best shared with strangers.” – England & Holland<br><br>

        “People come and go but if they're real friends you'll pick up where you left off like nothings ever changed.” - Japan<br><br>

        “Remember, what it cost to find happiness or where enlightenment comes from.” - Australia<br><br>

        “Over promising and under delivering was a pretty worded lie or an example of a lack in effort.” - America<br><br>

        “Chasing after everything will leave us with nothing. Eventually we have to make decisions.” – Canada<br><br>
