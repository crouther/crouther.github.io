		<p class="bMain" id = "lvb1QaA">My first book is a coming of age story; a fictional memoir about my childhood and the collective bonds between me and my friends. Ironically one of the main characters is inspired by "an imaginary friend", of sorts, we invented to provide disillusionment. After his passing, I was camping out one night at a work function; upon arrival home I immediately tanked into slumber. I had the most vivid dream of an alternate reality where we were all together again.<br><br> 

        In the middle of the dinner party he appears to me with a cocktail and steals the thunder one last time rifting on about his adventures into the next life. How if he could do it all again, he would have never opened the door of a time machine which created the rift between us all. How he'd have wished to join us one last time.<br><br> 

        He mentioned if he could mention anything to his parents one last time, he'd answer the question they always bugged him, "do you have a plan?"<br><br> 

        Now a bit wiser he said, "Yea, of sorts... I'd sit back and read romance novels, watch movies, play with my "Lion's share" of kids and oh... Can offer you...‚Äù The illusion of his presence begins to fade in the dream while he points to the virtual tour of his hypothetical home, family portrait, wife and kids.<br><br> 

        It seems he not only managed time travel but the art of displaying parallel dimensions in his final acts to try and re-establish himself with humanity. We were the best of friends right until our egos drove us to fierce competition.<br><br> 

        I knew him well and while I didn't want to mention anything, his speech was kind to the sensitive. He obviously wasn't completely dis-ingenuine but definitely wasn't completely rotted with regret.<br><br> 

        We obviously had different views on life, and I felt as though in his passing he attempted to realign his vision of a potential reality where we were all together again with a perception of life, he believed I would have wanted. Half heartily trying to non-affectionately bond. "patching" the cataclysmic wounds we dug into each other over the years in our Savage quest for the world at our feet.<br><br> 

        True to his nature he was quite the Rick in Rick and Morty...<br><br><br>

        So, he inspired one of your books, yea, of sorts, he was one of my many shared experiences that managed to be nostalgic enough for me to write down in the late-night hour, while churning the midnight oil. The delivery of this message is the key take away on how I came across many of the topics I've written, however.<br><br> 

        Anti-heroical lust of normalcy in counterculture to the Atlassian fable (Greek story of Atlas). The many tricked into carrying the weight of the world on his back only to remain as one of humanities foundations. Figurative wait and literal weight based on metaphoric translation.<br><br><br><br>
