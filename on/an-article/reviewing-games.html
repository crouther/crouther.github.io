            <h3 class="bMain">Why buy a PS4 in 2020?</h3>

            <p class="bMain">In 2017, I built a machine comparable if not more advance than the (2020) next generation gaming consoles. While each platform has its strengths and weaknesses, the experience they're aiming to achieve, I obtained 3-4 years earlier for 3-4x the price.<br><br>

            The main difference is while unused, my machine generates enough revenue to essentially pay for itself[*]. Basically making the upfront cost and mildly unfriendly user experience the only price to pay, overall, for the 2020-2021 standard gaming experience.<br><br>

            Acquiring the console at this point is simply for the cultural hardware trophy and exclusive software content; which doesn't age. Thus, investing early in advanced personal computing hardware allows me to wait for the most appropriate cost I see fit for any generation's essentially outdated hardware but exclusive platform experience.<br><br>

            *while this is my work machine I don't factor revenue generated from business operations but through SaaS operations*<br><br></p>

                    look for the light. stay positive. after everything we've been through, i want to talk about it, but that's all i got. i can't spoil it.<br><br>
                    it can't be for nothing, or was it?<br><br>

                    The first trilogy is driven by Kratos' rage from the death of his family, with it's competition reflecting on a father and son relationship. The newest addition picks up where the franchise left off only to focus on the life and experiences Kratos can provide towards his new "son".</p></div>

                    The Flash, Superman, Shazam!, Green Lantern and more all require highly dynamic environments due to the abilities of their characters. Highly destructive situations are common in their lore and previous generation's would've struggled to visualize their character's full potential. With modern hardware and the stretch of designer's imagination, these could easily be achieved. <span id="wishMore" style="color: tomato;" onclick="toggle();"> [ more ]</span><br><br>

                    <span id="wishCon" style="display: none;" onclick="toggleOff();">I'm going to focus on the DC Universe and Clark Kent. He's always seemed like the holy grail of complicated video game design dilemmas. How do you build a game around a character impervious to many human interventions? What would the health bar look like? He's bulletproof.<br><br>

                    I think the solution is simple; without the presence of kyptonite, change the focus of the objective. Don't make his life the measurement of success of failure. Make the lives of the victims the focus of each challenge, should he fail the world ends, should he fail, the citizens or victims die. Have their lives construct the narrative. Can the gamer continue if lives are lost. Does the story change if life is saved and the player completes the challenge.<br><br>

                    Design environments where destruction isn't an issue. A villain's base in a desert, a tundra, space; battles don't always have to take place in dense urban environments.<br><br>

                    Lean in on the human aspect of his life. His coming of age, his work life balance. His love affair with Lois, or lack thereof.<br><br>

                    In terms of action, like prior movies or comics bring in other Kryptonians for issues such as boss battles or combat challenges, equals who could stand toe to toe. For stealth missions they could range from hostage situations, military compounds in aforementioned areas such as the Middle East or Russia, extending his reach globally on journalistic expeditions. He could be reporting the war on terror or the cold war. Make his journey a period piece in an alternate universe.<br><br>

                    His enemies don't need to be humans. If he's an alien, if earth becomes futuristic or galactic, bring in space battles. with his flight, speed, and lasers, Earth's defenses could be the measure of failure. His ability to defend earth in one massive "Galaga" like battle could be an interesting game "arcade-y" mode. Defense against meteor showers. Protecting astronauts from asteroid fields during deep space expeditions. I feel there are so many available creative choices people could develop it matter or want not inability.<br><br>

                    Space expeditions that could lead to the discovery of other Kyptonians or Kyptonite. He could unknowingly help Lex Luther and his company explore space, only to later on realize the purpose of their deeds.<br><br>

                    If there is a space battle, lean in on the lore of his ability to gather strength from the sun.</span></p></div>
